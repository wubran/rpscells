# rpscells
3-state cellular automata using a Rock-Paper-Scissors ruleset.


3 colors:

dark blue eats light blue

light blue eats pure blue

pure blue eats dark blue


"eat" --> might convert neighbor pixel to own color (randomish to make things look rounder)


suggest making window smaller for performance


a square of cells near the cursor is frozen


doesn't use the GPU :skull:
